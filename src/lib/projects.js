        new verticals org, search experience team. Other responsibilites of my role include on-call rotations, building admin tooling, interviewing, and working
        on cross team projects to enable downstream dependencies.

        Apart from my expected tasks, I also took the initiative to launch a project that leverages Large Language Models like GPT-3 to save us 2 - 3
        million USD per year in offshore BPO vendor costs, as well as improve our catalog data significantly.`,

       <br><br> In 2022, after I started using generative AI [GPT, SD, etc.] to make business solutions, art, etc., I decided this is the field of tech I want to explore and establish myself in, and thus wanted to incorporate AI to be a core theme in  <a href='https://aparimeya.ai'>this website</a>'s design 
        But what does a particle simulation have to do with AI? Well, when I think of "intellegence", what comes to mind isn't neural networks, but rather something much more fundamental to our very existance: emergence. \ 
       <br><br> It's all around us and yet we rarely think about it in its most basic form, and so I figured this would make for an interesting interactive centerpiece. The order and patterns you observe in the chaotic soup of pixels flying around is not defined anywhere in the code; this is all just a result of a few basic rules that define how the 4 different 
        types of particles attract and repel each other [these values change as you scroll thus leading to new kinds of patterns]. 
        <br><br> Feel free to play around with the simulation hyper paramters [by clicking the cog icon in the bottom left] & check out my  <a href='https://aparimeya.xyz'>previous portfolio website</a> that I left up because I really like the centerpiece in that one too [space themed since I think space is really cool!].`,

        over the years I've even gotten the opportunity to be a part of countless freelancing gigs that involve graphic design.
        <br><br> Recently, I made a new page and tiktok account where I exclusively post art I make using AI tools [stable diffusion] called <a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@aparimeya'>@aparimeya.ai</a>`,

        This project taught me the scientific method hands on as I worked hundreds of hours in IIT Delhi's lab to build a NiOH fuel cell prototype and collect data points.
