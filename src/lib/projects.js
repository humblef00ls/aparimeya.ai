        Apart from my expected tasks, I also took the initiative to launch a project that leverages Large Language Models like GPT-3 to save us 2 - 3
        million USD per year in offshore BPO vendor costs, as well as improve our catalog data significantly.

       <br><br> In 2022, after I started using generative AI [GPT, SD, etc.] to make business solutions, art, etc., I decided this is the field of tech I want to explore and establish myself in, and thus wanted to incorporate AI to be a core theme in  <a href='https://aparimeya.ai'>this website</a>'s design 
        But what does a particle simulation have to do with AI? Well, when I think of "intellegence", what comes to mind isn't neural networks, but rather something much more fundamental to our very existance: emergence. \ 
       <br><br> It's all around us and yet we rarely think about it in its most basic form, and so I figured this would make for an interesting interactive centerpiece. The order and patterns you observe in the chaotic soup of pixels flying around is not defined anywhere in the code; this is all just a result of a few basic rules that define how the 4 different 
        types of particles attract and repel each other [these values change as you scroll thus leading to new kinds of patterns]. 
        <br><br> Feel free to play around with the simulation hyper paramters [by clicking the cog icon in the bottom left] & check out my  <a href='https://aparimeya.xyz'>previous portfolio website</a> that I left up because I really like the centerpiece in that one too [space themed since I think space is really cool!].`,

It helps track short term trends in the market and thus helps retail investors with more information.
        <br><br>
        I built it over the summer of 2020, after I saw some bizzare market movements and was curious to find out more. One thing led to another and I decided that building StockHub would be a great way to identify such behaviour and also help out all the retial investors I saw online who were trying to chase long term porfits with short term trends. It also runs NLP on each tweet and Reddit post to generate an average sentiment score for every stock, based on social mentions from the previous day.
        <br><br>
        It is built using Svelte/Sapper for the frontend, and GCP serverless for backend (interact with private APIs). More info and a diagram here.
        <br><br>
        Technologies used: Svelte, Sapper, GCP (Functions, Run, Scheduler, PubSub), Python, JavaScript, Node, Docker, Firebase (RTDB, Hosting, Analytics). 
        APIs used: Robinhood, YahooFinance, Twitter, and Reddit.
        <br><br>Unfortunately, due to mounting data storage costs and Robinhood changing their API [and also locking my account], this project is now deprecated and while you can still access historical data, it no longer updates :(`
